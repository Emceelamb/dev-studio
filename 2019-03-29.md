Today I continued doing some d3js visualizations. I worked on querying my data with javascript. Since I'm using d3js, found out that it isn't necessary to use SQL. I found it actually harder to query with SQL and have different routes pointing to different tables to fetch into d3. It's easier to just get all the data and use d3's query tools. It's a bit slower this way though and I have to eschew some of the asynch features.

Here is the code to cross reference a country and sum the refugees.

```
var refData = function getData(){
    let tmp = null;
    var rData = $.ajax({
        async: false,
         dataType: 'json',
         json: 'callback',
         url: 'http://localhost:8000/all',
         success: function (data) {
             console.log("success");
             //console.log(data);
             tmp = data;
         }
     });
    return tmp
}();

let countryRef = [];
let newTable = [];
refData.forEach(function (country){
    if(countryRef.includes(country.destination) === false){
        countryRef.push(country.destination);
    }
})
for(let i =0; i<countryRef.length;i++){
    let tmp = {"country": countryRef[i], "total": 0}
    newTable.push(tmp);
}
for(let i = 0; i < refData.length; i++){
    for(let j =0; j < newTable.length; j++){
        if(refData[i].destination === newTable[j].country){
           newTable[j].total += refData[i].refugees
        }
    }
}
```

After viewing the summed data, I realized that the UN's dataset is unreliable. After reading [their methodology](https://www.unhcr.org/statistics/STATISTICS/45c06c662.html "unhcr methodology") I learned that it is up to the host countries to report their refugee data. China and the USA notably have inaccurate reports. According to the dataset the US reported 2.3 million vietnamese refugees. This is impossible because the census reports only 1.3 million vietnamese in America. China reports are seem to be even more inaccurate with about 10 million refugees reported since 1975. 

~~After doing some digging into the cause, it seems that China reported the same number (300,897)  each year between 2005-2012. I'm not sure what is the best way to clean this up. I'm getting that~~

Actually I think I have the wrong understanding of the dataset. The number of refugees aren't necessarily referring to intake.  It seems some countries report their refugees differently. For example United States appears to report their intake, while China appears to report the number of refugees living in their country. Although, that doesn't explain why there are apparently so many VN refugees living in the united states (2.3m). I think I have to read more about their methodology to understand it.
