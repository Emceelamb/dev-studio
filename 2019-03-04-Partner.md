- In 1981 alone, when 452 boatsarrived in Thailand carrying 15,479refugees, UNHCR’s statistics were astudy in horror: 349 boats had beenattacked an average of three timeseach; 578 women had been raped;228 women had been abducted; and881 people were dead or missinjg.

- Over one million Vietnamese have been re-educated and returned tosociety since 1975, according to the Hanoi government. However,this would seem to contradict another official statement fromHanoi which said that 40,000 is the total number of Vietnamesewho have gone through the reeducation camps since 1975, and that26,000 remained in the camps as of 1980.(71) So if we are to takethese figures seriously, and try to reconcile them with-eachother, then we might assume that the one million figure includesthose who attended "short-term, on-the-spot" re- education, inwhich Vietnamese would come to the "classes" during the day andgo home at night, while the 40,000 figure refers to those whounderwent long-term re-education, meaning internment in thecamps. With regard to the latter, we must note that the estimatesof foreign observers of those detained in the camps since 1975are much higher, ranging up to 300,000.(72) Our own estimate isthat 100,000 Vietnamese are still in the camps. It would be moredifficult for us to estimate the total number detained in thecamps since 1975, and we will not attempt to estimate the numberof dissidents detained in the many prisons of Vietnam.

- NW 82 looks more like a concentration camp than a refugee sanctuary. A barren mud flat smaller than a football field, it was originally designed to hold 800 people. Today it is home to more than 1,900 listless Vietnamese "land people," who singly or in family groups bribed their way across Cambodia, which is still occupied by 160,000 Vietnamese troops.[time article about n282](https://ttnbg.blogspot.com/2007/11/time-article-about-nw-82.html "link to blogspot")
