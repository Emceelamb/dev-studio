# What do I want to do?

I've been struggling so far with my project and my goals. I talked to Danny and he made a comment on my choice of words. I mentioned that I wasn't sure about what the project means/ means to me. 

I think that this is one of my main struggles in this stage as I continue to define my project. There are two approaches to tackling the project: do I want to make it a very personal project where I trace back my family's past and their journey from Vietnam or do I take a more general approach that looks at all Vietnamese refugees.

I lean towards a more generalized approach, but primariily because I feel very vulnerable when talking about this subject. And even more so if I was to look into my family's history. 

I recently watched a TEDX by Brene Brown who spoke about the power of vulnerabiliy. Her position on vulnerability was that it is essential for happiness and joy. I appreciate her approach to this concept. I agree that vulnerability is instrinsic to a complete human experience, but I think too much vulnerability can be a problem. As it is I feel too afraid or even *too vulnerable* when talking about my own family that I am frozen in place and I can't get started. I think there has to be a balance between vulnerability and discomfort. So I'm inclined to go a more general route.
